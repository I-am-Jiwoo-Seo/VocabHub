# VocabHub

A vocabulary application that provides an organised way of storing your words.

You can also find the most appeared words within a paragraph before proceeding to read to ensure you understand the core words!

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. As this is my first deployed application, the code is not the best at the moment, but I am willing to improve constantly!

For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
